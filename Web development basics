**Introduction to Web Development**

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run on the internet. It involves a mix of technologies and techniques to build functional and visually appealing interfaces.


 **1. Types of Web Development**
1. **Frontend Development** (Client-Side):
   - Focuses on the visual aspect of a website that users interact with.
   - Technologies: 
     - **HTML** (Structure)
     - **CSS** (Styling)
     - **JavaScript** (Interactivity)
   - Example: Buttons, forms, animations.

2. **Backend Development** (Server-Side):
   - Handles the behind-the-scenes functionality.
   - Technologies: 
     - **PHP**, **Python**, **Node.js**, **Ruby**, etc.
   - Manages:
     - Server logic.
     - Database operations.
     - Authentication.

3. **Full-Stack Development**:
   - Combines both frontend and backend.
   - Full-stack developers are proficient in building a complete application.

4. **Database Management**:
   - Organizes, stores, and retrieves data for applications.
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle



**2. Types of Websites**
1. **Static Websites:**
   - Display fixed content.
   - Technologies: HTML, CSS.
   - Example: A personal portfolio page.

2. **Dynamic Websites:**
   - Display content that changes based on user interactions or data.
   - Technologies: PHP, Laravel, JavaScript frameworks.
   - Example: E-commerce sites, social media platforms.


**3. Key Concepts**
1. **Web Servers:**
   - Software that serves website files to users (e.g., Apache, Nginx).

2. **Browsers and Rendering:**
   - Browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display content.

3. **Responsive Design:**
   - Ensures websites look good on all devices (desktop, tablet, mobile).
   - Achieved using CSS frameworks (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap).

4. **Version Control Systems:**
   - Tools to track changes in your codebase.
   - Example: Git and platforms like GitHub.


**4. The Development Process**
1. **Planning:**
   - Define goals and requirements.
   - Create wireframes or prototypes.

2. **Design:**
   - Use tools like Figma or Adobe XD for UI/UX design.

3. **Development:**
   - Write and integrate code (frontend and backend).

4. **Testing:**
   - Ensure the website works across browsers and devices.
   - Check for security vulnerabilities.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Host the website using services like AWS, Heroku, or shared hosting.

6. **Maintenance:**
   - Update the website to fix bugs or improve performance.



 **5. Tools Youâ€™ll Use**
- **Code Editor:** Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text.
- **Browser Developer Tools:** Inspect elements, debug JavaScript.
- **Frameworks:** Laravel (PHP), React.js (JavaScript).
- **APIs:** Use services like Google Maps, weather APIs.
- **Git:** For version control and collaboration.



 **Practical Exercises:**
1. Create a simple HTML file, style it with CSS, and add basic JavaScript for interactivity.
2. Use Git to initialize a repository and push your code to GitHub.
3. Research a live server (e.g., XAMPP, WAMP) and set up a local environment.
