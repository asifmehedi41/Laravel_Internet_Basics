 **Internet Basics: Key Concepts**

Before diving into Laravel, understanding the basics of the internet is essential, as it forms the foundation of web development. Here’s a breakdown of what you should focus on:

**1. What is the Internet?**
- A global network of interconnected computers that communicate using standardized protocols.
- Works on the **client-server model**: 
  - The **client** (browser or app) makes a request.
  - The **server** (hosting data) processes and responds.


**2. HTTP and HTTPS**
- **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol):**
  - Foundation of data communication on the web.
  - Works by sending requests and receiving responses (e.g., viewing a webpage).
- **HTTPS:** Secure version of HTTP using encryption (SSL/TLS) for secure data transfer.


**3. Domain Names and IP Addresses**
- **Domain Names:** Human-readable addresses (e.g., `example.com`) for websites.
- **IP Addresses:** Numeric addresses (e.g., `192.168.1.1`) identifying devices on the internet.
- **DNS (Domain Name System):** Translates domain names into IP addresses.


**4. Web Hosting**
- A service that provides space on a server to store website files.
- Examples: Shared hosting, VPS, dedicated hosting, cloud hosting.



**5. Web Browsers**
- Applications that retrieve and display content from the web.
- Examples: Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
- Browsers interpret HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to render webpages.


 **6. HTTP Requests**
- **GET:** Retrieve data from a server.
- **POST:** Send data to the server (e.g., form submission).
- **PUT/PATCH:** Update existing data.
- **DELETE:** Remove data from the server.


**7. Client-Side vs. Server-Side**
- **Client-Side:**
  - Code runs on the user’s device (e.g., JavaScript, HTML, CSS).
- **Server-Side:**
  - Code executes on the server (e.g., PHP, Python, Node.js).



**8. APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**
- Mechanisms that allow applications to communicate with each other.
- Examples: Fetching weather data from a weather service.


**Practical Exercises:**
1. Use a web browser to inspect the source code of a webpage (right-click > View Page Source).
2. Use developer tools (F12) to monitor network requests.
3. Research a domain name’s IP address using an online DNS lookup tool.
